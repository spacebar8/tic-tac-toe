# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Play with friends or yourself.

Note: Need Python3 installed.

## How to Play
After running as a script, the user will be prompted to input names for 'player1' and 'player2', separated by whitespace. If no names are entered then 'player1' and 'player2' default to 'X' and 'O', respectively.
'X' always goes first and the turns alternate until there is a winner or a stalemate. Spaces in the Tic-Tac-Toe board will be marked by user input with the 'row' and 'col' indexed from 0-2, separated by whitespace.

### Example Turns
```
>>> 0 0

|X|_|_|
|_|_|_|
|_|_|_|

>>> 1 0

|X|_|_|
|O|_|_|
|_|_|_|
```
